## Normal user path (GitHub Releases ZIP)

Requires Node.js **22.x or 24.x** installed manually.

1. Download the ZIP from **GitHub Releases**.
2. Unzip it.
3. Double-click one launcher in the project folder:
   - `start-gui.bat` (Windows)
   - `start-guui.sh` (macOS/Linux)
   - Optional TUI launchers: `start.bat` / `start.sh`
4. The launcher now automatically:
   - checks Node/npm compatibility,
   - installs dependencies (TUI launchers use lightweight bootstrap without GUI/Electron packages),
   - builds if needed,
   - installs Playwright Chromium,
   - runs setup if config is missing/invalid,
   - launches download.
   - (first run may take longer while dependencies/build/Playwright install complete)
   - if install is interrupted, rerunning launcher repairs incomplete `node_modules`
5. Enter Blackboard credentials once in setup.
6. Select courses/files in TUI/GUI checkboxes.
7. On future runs, double-click the same launcher again.

See [README-USER.md](README-USER.md) for short student instructions.

## Developer path

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Panther114/blackbox.git
cd blackbox
npm install
npm run build
npm start download
```

## Commands

- `npm run bootstrap` – TUI bootstrap (installs required non-GUI dependencies, builds CLI, installs Playwright Chromium)
- `npm run bootstrap:gui` – GUI bootstrap (installs full GUI stack including Electron, builds CLI+GUI, installs Playwright Chromium)
- `npm run setup` or `node dist/cli.js setup` – setup wizard
- `node dist/cli.js setup --reset` – recreate config from scratch
- `node dist/cli.js setup --test-login` – save config then test Blackboard login (blank password keeps existing saved password)
- `node dist/cli.js config-check` – launcher-focused setup validity check
- `node dist/cli.js download` – interactive download flow
- `node dist/cli.js doctor` – environment and config checks
- `node dist/cli.js doctor --login` – includes a real login test
- `node dist/cli.js config` – print current effective config
- `npm run gui` – launch desktop GUI (no rebuild)
- `npm run gui:dev` – GUI development mode
- `npm run build:gui` – build CLI + GUI bundles

## Offline GUI screenshots

Run `npm run gui:demo` to launch a local renderer demo that never contacts Blackboard. The renderer also accepts seeded `screen` states for screenshot and layout QA:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173/?demo=1&screen=course-list
http://127.0.0.1:5173/?demo=1&screen=scan
http://127.0.0.1:5173/?demo=1&screen=metadata
http://127.0.0.1:5173/?demo=1&screen=files
http://127.0.0.1:5173/?demo=1&screen=download
http://127.0.0.1:5173/?demo=1&screen=diagnostics
```

The seeded states use local fixture data only. The normal download path remains network-backed and is not invoked by the demo.

## Agent and MCP integration

The installed Windows application can use credentials saved in Settings. Configure an MCP client to start its installed executable with `--mcp`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "blackbox": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Blackbox\\Blackbox.exe",
      "args": ["--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

For a portable CLI integration, configure `BB_USERNAME`, `BB_PASSWORD`, and `DOWNLOAD_DIR` in the MCP process environment (or a `.env` in its working directory), then use one of:

```bash
npx --yes blackbox@1.0.0 mcp
bunx --bun blackbox@1.0.0 mcp
```

The MCP tools are read-only: `blackboard_status`, `blackboard_list_courses`, `blackboard_sync`, and `blackboard_get_item`. `blackboard_sync` exports Markdown plus a manifest; set `include_files` only when attachments are needed.

## Strict document allowlist

Only these file types are accepted:
- `pdf`, `ppt`, `pptx`, `doc`, `docx`, `xls`, `xlsx`

Extension normalization behavior:
- Keeps valid supported extension if already present.
- Appends extension from MIME when name has no supported extension (example: `download` + `application/pdf` -> `download.pdf`).
- Rejects blocked extensions (archive/image/media/text/data) even when MIME claims a supported document.
- Replaces Blackboard-ish unknown extensions with MIME-derived supported extensions when MIME is supported (example: `download.aspx` + PDF MIME -> `download.pdf`).

## Progress display

- Download progress percentage is byte-based when file sizes are known.
- File count remains visible as secondary progress.
- If no known sizes are available, progress falls back to clearly labeled file-count mode.

## Reports and logs

After each run:
- Text summary: `logs/latest-summary.txt`
- JSON summary: `<DOWNLOAD_DIR>/blackbox-run-report.json`
- Main logs: `logs/blackbox.log`
