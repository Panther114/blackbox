# Blackbox (Student Quick Guide)

## First run

Before starting, install Node.js **22.x or 24.x** manually.

1. Download the project ZIP from GitHub Releases.
2. Unzip it.
3. Double-click:
    - **Windows:** `start.bat` (or `start.ps1`)
    - **macOS/Linux:** `start.sh`
    - **Optional GUI launchers:** `start-gui.bat` / `start-gui.ps1` / `start-gui.sh`
4. Follow setup prompts:
   - Blackboard username / G-number
   - Blackboard password
   - Download folder
5. Select courses and files in the checkbox screens (TUI) or GUI screens.

> First run may take extra time while dependencies, build output, and Playwright Chromium are prepared.
> TUI launchers (`start.*`) are lighter and recommended if GUI install fails.
> GUI launchers require Electron download and may need a stable network or VPN.

## Where files go

By default: `./downloads` inside the unzipped folder.
You can change this in setup.

## Run again later

Use the same launcher file again. Setup is reused automatically. If install fails midway, rerun the launcher and bootstrap will repair incomplete dependencies.

During downloads, percentage is byte-based when sizes are known; file count remains visible as secondary progress.

## Reset setup

Run:

```bash
node dist/cli.js setup --reset
```

## Run health checks

```bash
node dist/cli.js doctor
node dist/cli.js doctor --login
```

## If something fails

Open `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` and share `logs/blackbox.log` + `logs/latest-summary.txt` when asking for help.
